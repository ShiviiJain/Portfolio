      <h1>Challenges of Media Reporting</h1>
    
      <p>
        
        Historically, the distinction between opinion columns and editorials was more pronounced. However, the advent of diverse media formats has blurred these lines, making it more challenging for audiences to distinguish between unbiased reporting and opinionated content. To grasp the distinction between journalism and partisan storytelling, it's essential to understand the differing intent and methodologies that lie at the core of each. Professional “objective” Journalism stands for presenting any subject's facts, data, and information. A Journalist with this understanding strives to gather information impartially and ensure that the narrative is built upon facts which can be verified or falsified. The intent of Partisan storytelling is the propagation of certain beliefs and in essence, the end goal is to sway people’s opinions to match a singular rather than promoting the truth. The way one goes about this is by relying on pathos and narrating a story grounded in emotion <br> <br>
      </p>
      In the present day, there exists a blur between factual information and sensationalism. In areas like crime and environmental reporting, we often see unbiased and neutral presentation of facts. However, modern journalism faces challenges, particularly in reporting political media. Pursuing larger audiences has led some news outlets to adopt sensationalist tactics, like utilising flashy headlines to attract attention rather than inform. In political reporting, this could influence opinions and give the idea that a certain outlet is aligned with certain beliefs. According to a report by Pew Research Center, CNN is a distinct favourite of the left-leaning audience and Fox News is a distinct favourite of the right-leaning audience. These outlets are private corporations that value consumerism and focus on building revenue and viewership. This suggests a tendency for these outlets to produce content that aligns with the biases of their respective audiences. <br> <br>
      Despite these challenges, journalism must maintain its ethos. Balancing neutrality with the practicalities of viewership and revenue generation is like balancing on a tightrope. Even though blogs, opinion columns, and several biased sources of media out there exist, Journalism must always strive to be unbiased and objective. Rather than assigning an opinion to the audience, it should compel the audience to formulate their own opinion.
